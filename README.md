## ABOUT ME

Hi, I'm Lee Xiau Yeen. I am a former educator who has developed a strong passion for transforming data into actionable insights. My enthusiasm for data analysis has inspired me to pursue a new direction in my professional journey. Therefore, I decided to take a significant step towards my goal by enrolling in the Data Analytic Career Accelerator programme through the London School of Economics (LSE). This experience allowed me to gain vital skills and practical knowledge that are essential for a data analyst.
